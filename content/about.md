Hi there,

My name is Julien (aka. Eval on the Internet).

I am a security professional with experience working in fast-paced & dynamic startup environments. My main topic of interest lies in the offensive security space (application security and red-teaming).

Outside of work, I spend a significant amount of time training for rock-climbing competitions as well as various outdoor adventures.

Feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xEval) for anything infosec-related or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcouvy/) for professional enquiries.

You can also check my profiles in various amazing trainings platforms:

Thank you for reading, and have a great day ☀️!
