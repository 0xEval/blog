For those curious about me,

I am a security professional with experience working in fast-paced & dynamic startup environments. My main topics of interest lie in the offensive security space (application security and red-teaming), as well as blockchain and smart contract development.

Outside of work, I spend a significant amount of time training for rock-climbing competitions as well as various outdoor adventures.
