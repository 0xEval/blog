Player was a really enjoyable machine, a lot of initial enumeration work was needed as well as keeping track and note down everything found. A few hints are laid out throughout the whole search and they all connect together nicely.

Let's get started.

# Initial Enumeration

Since I am lazy of running the same enumeration process every time I start a machine on HTB, I decided to try one of the reconnaissance script available out there.¬†

I ended up using https://medium.com/@Tib3rius (credits to Tib3rius for his work, thank you)

```

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2396 Oct 11 15:05 _top_20_udp_nmap.txt
```

We find three running services on `tcp/80` (apache), `tcp/22` (ssh), `tcp/6686` (ssh)

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION                                                                                                      
22/tcp   open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 6.6.1p1 Ubuntu 2ubuntu2.11 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp   open  http    syn-ack ttl 63 Apache httpd 2.4.7
6686/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 7.2 (protocol 2.0)
```

The web server running sends back an `Unauthorised 403` Error page when trying to access `/`. Let's try to find other interesting pages with some directory listing.

```
$ cat tcp_80_http_gobuster.txt
(...)
/.htaccess (Status: 403) [Size: 288]
/launcher (Status: 301) [Size: 314]
/server-status (Status: 403) [Size: 292]
```

Good we have another lead. But before digging deeper, let's see what else could be found (breadth-first search). Previous boxes used virtual hosting to host multiple pages.¬†

We will use https://github.com/codingo/VHostScan to quickly look for these.

```
$ VHostScan -t 10.10.10.145 -oN vhosts_scan.txt -v --ignore-http-codes 403,404

The output contains a few hits (with some false positives, redirecting to the main domain). I sorted the valid vhosts manually by editing the Host: header in Burp Suite and observing the response. We end up with the following accessible pages which we append to /etc/hosts for ease-of-use.
player.htb (main domain)
staging.player.htb
dev.player.htb
chat.player.htb
```

# Enumerating: player.htb

{{< figure src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*-p3mjig4nkJbS30v57uNZw.png" width="800"  caption="Countdown on main¬†domain" >}}

We find the source code of the countdown in JS files. Everything seems to happen client-side, it is very unlikely that modifying it would have any impact on the server.

```
var countDown = function() {
    var d = new Date(new Date().getTime() + 800 * 120 * 120 * 2000);
    simplyCountdown('.simply-countdown-one', {
    year: d.getFullYear(),
    month: d.getMonth() - 7,
    day: d.getDate()
  });
};
```

The source code of the page reveals one interesting file `dee8dc8a47256c64630d803a4c40786c.php` which is called when the user clicks on the Send button. Let's observe the traffic in Burp Suite to have a better understand of what is happening.

We see regular calls (~5 sec intervals) to the following PHP page: `dee8dc8a47256c64630d803a4c40786e.php`

{{< figure src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*WTGoLQmmkrfCNSTBhqg-sA.png" title="Polling function with an access¬†token" width="800" >}}

Decoded JWT:

```
Headers = {
 "typ" : "JWT",
 "alg" : "HS256"
}
Payload = {
 "project" : "PlayBuff",
 "access_code" : "C0B137FE2D792459F26FF763CCE44574A5B5AB03"
}
Signature = "cjGwng6JiMiOWZGz7saOdOuhyr1vad5hAxOJCiM3uzU"
```

Nothing else stands out, the traffic is very quiet. At this point we don't have much to play with. Further attempts at enumerating did not give anything. We move on to another vhost

# Enumerating: staging.player.htb

{{< figure src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*tjBjAJyV0ck_gTscgVzmmA.png" title="Virtual host found on staging.player.htb" width=800 >}}

**Product Updates tab** will regularly query `update.php` which will fetch an image from the server. Nothing much to do about it.

While navigating to the Contact Core Team tab, we briefly see an error message before being redirected to `501.php`. Let's observe what happens with our web proxy

{{< figure src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*-tEZ6PQ3pjYjo1XNmcElJA.png" title="Verbose error message on contact.php" width="800" >}}

# Enumerating: dev.player.htb

This vhost caused me the most trouble, I hunted for SQLi or authentication bypass but to no avail. My mistake was to trust my wordlists a bit too much instead of using my brain.

{{< figure src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*gcjSRPrUWZm4-PojoHdL2A.png" title="Login page on dev.player.htb" width="800" >}}

Navigating through the JavaScript files we understand that this portal is for a Cloud IDE called Codiad.¬†

What's interesting about it¬†? We have an authenticated [Remote Code Execution (RCE)](https://github.com/WangYihang/Codiad-Remote-Code-Execute-Exploit) exploit available üòç

The credentials are still unknown, let's keep going...

I mentioned using my brain, this is a development portal. What is commonly used in development¬†? Versioning software. But wait‚Ää-‚ÄäI did check for an existing¬†`.git/` or¬†`.svn/` directory. What I forgot to check (and which was not included in the wordlists I used, to my surprise) was the¬†`.gitignore` file.

```
*~
*\#
*.swp
config.php
data/
workspace/
plugins/*
!plugins/README.md
themes/*
!themes/default/
!themes/README.md
.project
.buildpath
.settings/
.svn/
vendor/
composer.lock
```

Truth is, this finding was nothing but another hint and you could have progressed without it. The takeaway here was to look for backup files often left-over by editors in their default configuration.

# Enumerating: chat.player.htb

Nothing other than the main page was found on this vhost. We are gifted two hints:

1. There is way to access Playbuff source code
2. We might find interesting data on the Staging vhost

This is the last vhost that I checked when I worked on the machine. It forced me to dig deeper on the main domain and helped me connect the pieces of the puzzle.

{{< figure src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*HBbnQauYmD70h437qHbroQ.png" width="800" title="Virtual host found on chat.player.ht'" >}}

# Backtracking to the main¬†domain

At this point we know a few more things.¬†

1. There is a potential RCE on dev.player.htb but we need credentials.
2. There is a way to disclose Playbuff source code and access the app.
3. There might be backup files stored somewhere.

I tried appending backup extension to a couple of files in all vhosts while forgetting about the main domain for a while. But then, I remembered. Maybe‚Ä¶ I could get a backup file of these weird php files (which completely make sense considering point 2. and 3.).

# Accessing Playbuff Pre-release
Indeed, a quick curl to `dee8dc8a47256c64630d803a4c40786c.php~` reveals very juicy information:


> JWT Generation logic found on backup `dee8dc8a47256c64630d803a4c40786c.php~`

{{< gist 0xEval 16d20692f60b99ec0a378ba09996c755 >}}

The program will decode the JWT found in the user's session cookies and redirect him to the product page depending on the value of access_code.

Let's generate a new JWT which will contain the the leaked key

To make sure we replicate the same backend behaviour, we will install the same php library (https://github.com/firebase/php-jwt) in our local machine.



> Generate a Firebase JWT in our local machine

{{< gist 0xEval 1cf2512622707a7685b0b1f236589356 >}}

```
$ php generate_firebase_jwt.php

[+] New Access Token: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJwcm9qZWN0IjoiUGxheUJ1ZmYiLCJhY2Nlc3NfY29kZSI6IjBFNzY2NTg1MjY2NTU3NTYyMDc2ODgyNzExNTk2MjQwMjYwMTEzOTMifQ.VXuTKqw__J4YgcgtOdNDgsLgrFjhN1_WwspYNf_FjyE
```

Now, we just need to query `dee8dc8a47256c64630d803a4c40786c.php` after modifying our access cookie with the newly generated JWT.

We get redirected to the following page:

{{< figure src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*SZrahs05UqCmX167NquE2Q.png" title="Hidden pre-release product¬†PlayBuff" >}}

# Exploiting the upload function (magic happens‚Ä¶)

After playing around with the upload feature with Burp Suite (web proxy) on the side, we quickly understand the server will receive whatever uploaded file (it doesn't really matter), compress it, and store the result in a¬†`.avi` file.

Since we know the box runs under a Linux environment, we can make the educated guess that it would perform the conversion with a common tool such as `FFmpeg`.¬†

A quick Google search also reveals a few very recent CVEs found on the same software‚Ä¶ ü§î

There is a known way to perform Local File Inclusion (LFI) by exploiting the way FFmpeg processes HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) playlists. More information [here](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Upload%20Insecure%20Files/CVE%20Ffmpeg%20HLS)

We use the following script authored by (neex): https://github.com/neex/ffmpeg-avi-m3u-xbin/blob/master/gen_xbin_avi.py

```
$ python3 gen_xbin_avi.py file:///etc/passwd read_hostname.avi
```
'
We upload the file on PlayBuff and retrieve the output using the URL sent back by the app. This where the magic happens, once you open the video, you can see the actual content of the file being displayed back.

{{< figure src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ecvFdCVeOllpOolvT2LYGg.png" title="Yerrr a wizard¬†Harry‚Ä¶" >}}

However, this data is not very interesting‚Ä¶ Instead, which known file could be juicy to read? Let's repeat the same for `/var/www/backup/service_config`¬†!

We can see the following credentials displayed in the video

```
User: telegen
Password: d-bC|jC!2uepS/w
```

# Escaping Restricted Shell

As with everything with this box, it is important to remember all our previous steps and enumeration. The credentials do not seem to work on the Codiad IDE hosted on `dev.player.htb`

However, we did find two SSH services running earlier in our enumeration process.

{{< figure src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ijdZCQq9B_rh5lclsNcYxw.png" title="Connecting to SSH (port: 6686) using stolen credentials from backup/service_config" >}} 

Great¬†! We managed to land a shell. But, it's a restricted / limited shell (lshell) which means we can't do much in the current state of things.

Trying out common jail escape techniques did not get us very far. Actually we are strictly limited to the following set of commands:

```
clear exit help history lpath lsudo
```

Long story short, the whole jail escape thing appears to be a big rabbit üê∞ hole. But once again, we need to remember our previous steps.¬†

The SSH service on port **6686** is running **OpenSSH v7.2** for which there is a known (Authenticated) Command Injection‚Ää-‚Ääand we just found a valid set of credentials.

{{< figure src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*huWtkLTflM4ULDWn3fpPig.png" title="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39569" >}}

# Exfiltrate all the¬†things‚Ä¶

First things first, we can now somewhat bypass the jail restriction and read files as user telegen¬†. This means we can snatch our first loot user.txt¬†

```
#> .readfile /home/telegen/user.txt: 30e**************************f48
```

At this point we have very limited knowledge about the available files on the host. We try a few common hits to get an idea of our user privileges but we can't get to read a lot of interesting files‚Ää-‚Ääexcept one, `fix.php` (hint from the error message found earlier).

```
(...)
public
if(!$username){
$username
$password
}
//modified
//for
//fix
//peter
//CQXpm\z)G5D#%S$y=
}
(...)
```

These credentials are very likely to be from a developer.

# Escalating to www-data¬†user

During our enumeration on the `dev.player.htb` vhost, we identified an authenticated RCE on the Codiad IDE. Now that we have a set of valid credentials we can definitely leverage the vulnerability:

{{< figure src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*cgRfnw2IxFyNFZ2UimaCnA.png" title="Reverse shell from Codiad¬†RCE" >}}

# Escalating to root¬†user

My go-to step when trying to find a way to escalate to superuser is to download https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration somewhere in the victim system (/dev/shm or /tmp are good candidates).¬†

If nothing pops-out from the script, then I tend to monitor the running processes using https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy.

In this machine, I did not get a lot of interesting stuff from lse.sh¬†; however, I noticed root was regularly running the following php program.


> `/var/lib/playbuff/buff.php`:

{{< gist 0xEval be4ed207b079ff4b175abfbd85937bb5 >}}

Luckily, the PHP file included in the file which **root** user will execute periodically is writeable by our user `www-data`. We simply need to backdoor the `dee8dc8a47256c64630d803a4c40786g.php` file with a reverse shell to our attacker machine and it should do the trick.


> Backdoored PHP file which will be executed by `include()`:

{{< gist 0xEval 1b7537c9027683e75399102afb02d3db >}}

Waiting a couple of seconds for the cronjob to run and we'll get our root shell.¬†
